* Hello Everyone
A very beautiful quote thanks to the courtesy of *John Maxwell*. Two days ago,
Aasish Sir shared me with a message:

#+begin_quote
For people graduating in 2019 and 2020 if you want to apply in Microsoft for FTE
or intern, send your resume to [[mailto:sanjliagarwal@gmail.com][sanjliagarwal@gmail.com]].

* Initial thoughts
What an opportunity! And here I’m, not even prepared my *Resume* till now…

** Why?
Um-mm, I had planned to prepare it in Summers just like earlier when [[https://sites.google.com/view/the-launchpad/dev][Dev]] and
[[https://sites.google.com/view/the-launchpad/abhijit][Abhijit]] made their own. Ample of time to think *What goes in and What not*.

* Thank you
