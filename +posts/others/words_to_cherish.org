Two days ago, Aasish Sir shared me a message:

#+begin_quote
*March ~30~, 2017 (Friday)*

For people graduating in 2019 and 2020 if you want to apply in Microsoft for FTE
or intern, send your resume to [[mailto:sanjliagarwal@gmail.com][sanjliagarwal@gmail.com]].
#+end_quote

* Initial thoughts
What an opportunity! And here I‚Äôm, not even have prepared my *Resume* till now‚Ä¶

** Why?
Um-mm, I had planned to prepare it in summers just like earlier when [[https://sites.google.com/view/the-launchpad/dev][Dev]] and
[[https://sites.google.com/view/the-launchpad/abhijit][Abhijit]] made their own. Ample time to think *‚ÄúWhat goes in and What not‚Äú*.

** What I missed?
Precious *time*, to manage and prepare better in advance. On top of that, today
was the last date and I‚Äôd to go to the College for some paperwork and registrations.

* A weird idea
Due to the hurry for which only I was responsible, I couldn‚Äôt think of any
experiments with the layout/structure and contents of the resume.

Was just‚Ä¶ *total silence!*

*Later a wierd thought came to use [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v1XE-k13ZKbxA6Gybhz3x39ZRXFpsIS7VmNWvHN7Jlc/present?slide=id.p4][Dev‚Äôs Resume]] as a template*, in the time of peril.

* The discussion
In the meantime, Sir suggested me to *include a cover letter* and try to highlight
my *strengths and personality*.

For once I thought that whether Sir meant by the usual formal-format resume
rather than the powerpoint one which I was thinking.

So He clarified that I should I continue and try not to use too many colours and
also to take care of consistency throughout the presentation.

** But hey‚Ä¶
Till now Sir didn‚Äôt knew that I was about to use a template rather than
experimenting out myself.

#+begin_danger
This was soon going to be a mistake!
#+end_danger

*And I continued‚Ä¶*

* The result
Though was not at all satisfied because all the work had lost it‚Äôs authenticity.
Still happy with whateverI could do in the limited time.

  </p>
<br>
#+end_export

Even though I used a template, I tried to think/use my own beliefs and
personality traits as *accurate and authentic* as I could given the time I‚Äôd left.

Shared with the Sir (had mailed it to the Ma‚Äôam too) and He replied:

** TODO Words to cherrish
- *Templates are the barriers for creativity*.
- *Be inspired , but stay open to experiment with different forms.*
- Idea is to *communicate the key messages* about you effectively
- In a manner that is *impactful*.
- *Right messages* are drawn.

And the *receiver should have a ~smile~ on face the moment your profile comes across!*

* Moments later
Suddenly Sir shared a convo:

Sir had shared the resume with a different group and then replied:

#+begin_quote
In my eyes resume is good.

However u may want to review from a point of someone unknown.\\
It will be understood by people who respect independent thinking.
#+end_quote

Beautiful words once again! Here‚Äôs how I replied back:

#+begin_quote
üòã *Honest feedback is little hard these days...* Really happy to hear that.
üôèüôè For it is the opportunity ‚ú® to improve even further!

*We are only as good as the exposure*, ‚úå

I'll definitely devote decent üïê time in thought process from the  audience
perspective first before doing anything.

Will work from scratch, Keeping those points in mind.

Thank you Sir, *for sharing*, üôè
#+end_quote

I was fortunate enough to get such a wonderful opportunity to learn and improve further!

* TODO Current plan
Will do a fair amount of experimentation first, gather feddback and improvise.
Then see how it goes.

* Quote of the day

#+begin_quote
"The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute, the man who does not ask is
a fool for life."

Cheers!

* Thank you
